# A small frog wants to get to the other side of a river. The frog is at 
# position 0, and wants to get to position X. Leaves fall onto the river 
# at different positions and times, represented by array A.
# Each element in array A represents a leaf falling at position A[i] at 
# second i. Write a function that returns the earliest time when the frog 
# can jump to the other side of the river (i.e. when all positions from 1 
# to X have at least one leaf). If the frog canâ€™t cross, return -1.

# get a set to store unique positions
