# You have N counters, all starting at 0.

# Youâ€™re given an array A representing operations:

# If A[i] is between 1 and N, it means "increase counter A[i] by 1".

# If A[i] == N + 1, it means "set all counters to the max counter value so far".

# Your job: Return the final state of all counters after performing all operations efficiently.
